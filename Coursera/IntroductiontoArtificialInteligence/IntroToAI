## Retrieval Augmented Generation
RAG is an advanced method that combines the strengths of generative AI models with external information retrieval mechanisms to address several limitations inherent in generative models.

RAG addresses the limitations of generative AI models by retrieving relevant documents or data from a corpus before generating a response.

RAG incorporates a retrieval step to ensure that the generative model is grounded in actual data, thus reducing the risk of hallucinations.
RAG has several applications, including:

* Question-answering systems
* Content creation
* Customer support
* Search engines

### Google Cloud
Google Cloud provides robust tools and frameworks for implementing RAG models, including Vertex AI and BigQuery. These platforms facilitate the integration of retrieval mechanisms with large language models (LLMs) , enabling the development of scalable and efficient RAG applications.

+ Vertex AI: It offers a comprehensive suite for building and deploying machine learning models, including support for RAG frameworks.

+ BigQuery: It allows efficient querying and retrieval of large datasets, providing a robust backend for the retrieval component of RAG models.
